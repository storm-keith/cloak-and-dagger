            <br>
            <p class="text-center text-white font-weight-light"> By Edgar Allan Poe - Published 1843</p>


            <img src="../src/images/1.jfif" class="story_img">
            <p class="text-justify font-weight-normal">True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and
                am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled
                them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I
                heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can
                tell you the whole story.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and
                night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He
                had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He
                had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran
                cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus
                rid myself of the eye forever.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should
                have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I
                went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And
                every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when
                I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light
                shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in!
                I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an
                hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!
                would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the
                lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much
                that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights --every night
                just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it
                was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly
                into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how
                he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that
                every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.
                <br>
                <br>
                <!--
                Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves
                more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my
                sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door,
                little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the
                idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that
                I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were
                close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door,
                and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when
                my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?" I
                kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did
                not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after
                night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.

                Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of
                pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when
                overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept,
                it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I
                say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew
                that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears
                had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had
                been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the
                floor," or "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort
                himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in
                approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the
                mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard
                --to feel the presence of my head within the room.

                When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little
                --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily,
                stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice
                and fell full upon the vulture eye. It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon
                it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the
                very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had
                directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what
                you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low,
                dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was
                the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the
                soldier into courage.

                But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how
                steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It
                grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been
                extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well I have told you that I am
                nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so
                strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained
                and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new
                anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud
                yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I
                dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so
                far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me;
                it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and
                examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there
                many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.

                If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for
                the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I
                dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. I then took up three planks from
                the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so
                cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing wrong. There
                was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A
                tub had caught all --ha! ha! When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as
                midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it
                with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves,
                with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the
                night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and
                they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade
                the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent
                in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led them, at
                length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my
                confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I
                myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which
                reposed the corpse of the victim.

                The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while
                I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and
                wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still
                chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely
                to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the
                noise was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a
                heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much
                such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard
                it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued
                about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why
                would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the
                observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved
                --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise
                arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted
                pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they
                suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But
                anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those
                hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder!
                louder! louder! louder!

                "Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is
                the beating of his hideous heart!"
                -->
