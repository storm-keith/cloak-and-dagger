                            <p> This happened when I was in high school.
                                My mother was from a family with strong spiritual roots, so I’d long been able to see
                                and feel such types of things. This story is about one of those things.
                                At the time, our family often ate meals late at night, and we always went out to do so.
                                On this particular day, my father felt like ramen, so we went out to eat that. We lived
                                in the mountains way out in the countryside, so whenever we went out we had to use a car
                                to get anywhere.
                                <div class="text-center text-primary btn-pad">

                                        story....</a>
                                </div>
                                <!--My father drove, and I sat in the back behind him. I stared out the
                                window as my parents chatted.
                                Suddenly I saw an old woman standing in the middle of a field. It was after 10 p.m. and
                                there were no streetlights, so it was pitch black. It was the countryside, so there were
                                no houses nearby either. I found it strange, but I told myself that maybe she forgot
                                some of her work tools and was just retrieving them.
                                Thinking back on it now, there were no other cars around, so how could she have gotten
                                there? But there were so many strange points that I didn’t even consider it.
                                We ate ramen, returned home, and then I went to bed. I quickly fell asleep as always,
                                but then around 2 a.m. I suddenly woke up. I couldn’t move.
                                
                                I suffered from sleep paralysis roughly once a month, and so all I thought was ‘again?’
                                But that was just the start of something I’d never experienced before.
                                With sleep paralysis, generally you can’t move. That’s it. But then I suddenly felt
                                something grab my ankle. That had never happened before, and while it seemed strange, I
                                could do nothing about it. I was frozen. Then the sensation of the hand gradually
                                crawled further up my body.
                                By the time it reached my hips I began to panic. I debated whether I should try to look
                                or not, over and over. I realised that I was going to see whoever it was anyway, so I
                                might as well do it of my own volition. I worked up the courage and, finally able to
                                move my arm, lifted the blanket.
                                I soon regretted it.
                                That old woman from the field was underneath it. She glared at me angrily, her
                                expression indescribable, but that wasn’t the only thing that terrified me. In her hand
                                she tightly gripped a sickle…
                                For a moment we stared at each other, and unsure of what to do, I decided to put the
                                blanket back down on top of her. As I did, the paralysis gripping my body broke free.
                                I closed my eyes as though nothing had happened, but it didn’t get rid of the sensation
                                of her hand by my hips. Before long I could feel her moving up again. If she kept going,
                                it wouldn’t be long until we locked eyes again, so I desperately started chanting an
                                incantation that my mother had taught me. I discovered later that it was an incantation
                                used in Shingon Buddhism to dispel evil spirits.
                                I must have repeated it about 10 times before the weight on me lifted and disappeared. I
                                carefully lifted the blanket, wondering if she was still there, but she was gone.
                                I later discovered that the owner of the field where I’d seen the ghost had died that
                                day. Perhaps that was who I’d seen. Ever since then, I’ve run into ghosts quite a lot.

                            <p>It began just outside my door — the door that bore on pebbled glass the following
                                information:

                                The blonde girl with the black cat in her arms let out a shriek just beyond the said
                                door. Then she lunged through the said door and fell dead across my desk, and the ebony
                                cat streaked away!

                                "Plain case of murder," said fizzy Police Inspector Gogalvatty, rolling his little piggy
                                eyes into a glare of suspicion. "Plain case of murder right here in the office of this
                                dumb shamus who tries to make us believe she staggered into his presence with a
                                .22-automatic slug under her left arm. Besides, if you heard the shot, why didn't you
                                jump out of your chair instead of, as you say, waiting until too late?"
                                They carted the blonde's body over to the morgue. Gogalvatty was moving about my office
                                with a magnifying glass in his pudgy fist, hoping he'd find something that would give my
                                story the lie. "It's a good thing you bumped her," he said, "or I would have died for
                                want of excitement; it's been dull so long."
                                "My dear friend, Gogalvatty," I said depreciatingly, "I did not bump her. It's not a
                                nice thing to say, to say there's anything good about a swell dame like that being
                                bumped. I'd like to know what there is good about it. And for the twentieth time within
                                the small space of two hours I have said to you, my dear friend, Gogalvatty — I did not
                                kill the blonde beauty."
                                "You could have gotten rid of the gun," Gogalvatty tossed his two hundred and forty
                                pounds of fat out of my Morris. "You could've dropped it out the window. You could've —
                                "
                                "Swallowed it," I said, with dignified rancor. "You, Gogalvatty, are an ass; you have
                                big ears and a bray and a barnyard smell. Why don't you scram and let me find out in my
                                own way why murder dropped in on me the very day my rent was due?"-->

                                to day, night to night, until you maybe ran into an old friend who slipped you a five,
                                and somebody saw you get it;
                                there at dawn an interne from city hospital would shove
                                your eyelid up with a clean, pink thumb. “Icebox meat,” he’d say. “Morgue bait.”

                                maybe, as he stood up, he’d look down at your hollow grey face and the sharp bones of
                                your wrists and wonder how you’d kept alive so long. So very long.
                                But something happened to Bay Street. It acquired glamor. Reading the trend, the smart
                                boys came down and bought up the property and built long low clubs with blue lights and
                                bright music and expensive drinks. The shining cars lined up along the curb, and the
                                people with the clean clothes gave ragged kids two bits to make certain the tires
                                weren’t slashed while they were inside the places with the bright music and the soft
                                women. The doormen at the new places had no time for the men in broken shoes who were
                                living out the last years of addiction.
                                So the men of Bay Street moved to Dorrity Street—one block over. Many of the displaced
                                little bars moved over. The red, blue and green neon flickered against the brick flanks
                                of the ancient warehouses, and, in the night, the steaming chant of the jukeboxes, the
                                hoarse laughter and the scuff of broken shoes was the same as always.
                                Frank Bard sat on the stone front step of an abandoned warehouse and stared at the
                                street, shining in a light misty rain. The rain made pink halos around the neon of the
                                place across the street. “Allison’s Grill.”-->
