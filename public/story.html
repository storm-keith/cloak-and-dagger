                        <h6> December 10, 2019</h6>

                        <p>
                            <br>
                            There used to be a program on Japanese TV called Terebi no Chikara. One day, however, it was
                            suddenly pulled off the air. It was a program that attempted to find missing people,
                            informing the public of their story and using profilers, investigators, and even psychics in
                            an attempt to uncover their whereabouts.<br><br>

                            One particular episode of the show focused on a young boy who had gone missing. An American
                            psychic was brought in to find his location, however, the answer the psychic gave shocked
                            all involved.
                            <br><br>
                            “This child is all over the world.”
                            <br><br>
                            In other words, the boy was already dead. His organs were sold on the black market and had
                            already been transplanted into various people all around the world. The show decided that
                            they would be unable to air the episode, and in the end the entire show itself was
                            cancelled.
                            <br><br>
                            Terebi no Chikara stopped airing in 2006. Whether you believe the rumours for why and how it
                            ended is up to you, but there’s no denying that the show, which was extremely popular at the
                            time, came to an abrupt end.

                            There is a Jizo statue on Mount Rokko in Hyogo Prefecture that people say waves at
                            passersby. Just as its name states, it appears to be waving when you like at it, like
                            saying, “Bye bye.”

                            But you must be careful if you look at the Waving Jizo when you’re driving by. If it looks
                            like it’s waving goodbye then there’s no problem, but if it seems to be beckoning you
                            instead, that means you will soon be involved in an accident… <br><br>

                            One day, C got home from a work trip to find the “missed call” light on his phone. As he was
                            listening, he heard a familiar sound that he recognised from somewhere. It was a raw sound
                            that continued for a whole minute. Badum. Badum.<br><br>

                            A few days later, C went to visit his uncle, a practising doctor, and had him listen to the
                            call.
                            <br><br>
                            “That’s the sound of a naked heart from an open chest!” he said.

                            Someone out there had cut open another person’s chest and was making people listen to it on

                        <h6> December 3, 2019</h6>

                        <p>
                            <br>
                            It’s said that the JR Chuo Line in Tokyo has a lot of traffic accidents that result in
                            deaths each and every year. And, it’s said, that in areas that see a particularly large
                            number of deaths, memorial stones are placed in areas the public can’t see. One of those
                            places is JR Shinjuku Station. The surveillance cameras have caught many such accidents on
                            tape over the years. One particular accident that was caught on camera saw someone stumble
                            forward as though they had been pushed from behind. The person fell onto the tracks and was
                            then hit by a train.
                            <br><br>
                            Was this the work of some unseen power? Rumours state that to sooth this unknown and
                            invisible “something,” a memorial stone was placed in the station dedicated to those who
                            have lost their lives on the tracks. According to staff who work at the station, the rumours
                            that a memorial stone exists somewhere within the station is true, but they deny that
                            “something” exists that pushes people onto the tracks. The memorial stone is apparently
                            dedicated to those involved in construction of the station who died in accidental deaths
                            when the station was renovated and repaired in 1936.

                            In other words, the boy was already dead. His organs were sold on the black market and had
                            already been transplanted into various people all around the world. The show decided that
                            they would be unable to air the episode, and in the end the entire show itself was
                            cancelled.

                            Terebi no Chikara stopped airing in 2006. Whether you believe the rumours for why and how it
                            ended is up to you, but there’s no denying that the show, which was extremely popular at the
                            time, came to an abrupt end.

                        There is a Jizo statue on Mount Rokko in Hyogo Prefecture that people say waves at
                        passersby. Just as its name states, it appears to be waving when you like at it, like
                        saying, “Bye bye.”
                        <br><br>
                        But you must be careful if you look at the Waving Jizo when you’re driving by. If it looks
                        like it’s waving goodbye then there’s no problem, but if it seems to be beckoning you
                        instead, that means you will soon be involved in an accident… <br><br>
